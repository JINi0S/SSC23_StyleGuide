# StyleGuide
"Style Guide" is an app where you can create your own iOS style guide.

<br/>

## Planning intention

I have previously worked on a personal project focusing on UI rather than usability. I realized that this approach was lacking in usability because it spent more time on the visual side than thinking about the functionality.

Based on these experiences, I decided to create an app that would allow me to think about UI before starting development. This app is intended to give people planning a personal project an experience of a style guide. Through this, we want to help you implement UI and UX in harmony.

<br/>

## Necessity

If you create a style guide before you start developing your iOS personal project, you will be able to focus more on UX than UI when developing apps. In addition, it can maintain a consistent style, giving a consistent feeling throughout the app. If you create a style guide first, you can decide on design elements first, reducing the need to modify or change the UI during the actual development phase.

## Function

- You can modify the app icon, profile, color palette, buttons, controls, typography, and notification directly.
- Press the Draw button to create a canvas where you can draw the app icon yourself, and you can choose a color and draw it yourself.
- If the user allows it, the photo app will be accessible to save the final screen as a photo app.
- A question mark button is provided to view the Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) content and tips. This allows users to modify their styles by viewing guidelines for iOS interface design.
- Press the initialize button to reset all settings in the Style Guide. This allows the user to return to their initial state.
